# Nike Brand Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for a Nike brand landing page built using Tailwind CSS and React. The project features a sleek, modern design with support for dark mode. Dark mode is implemented using the `useContext` hook, and the user's theme preference is saved in local storage using the `useEffect` hook, ensuring the selected theme persists even after the browser is refreshed.

## Features

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes the utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Dark Mode**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes using React's `useContext` hook.
- **Persistent Theme**: Saves the user's theme preference in local storage using the `useEffect` hook to maintain the selected theme across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
